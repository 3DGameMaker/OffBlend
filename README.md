Thanks to https://github.com/calcoloergosum/blender-off-axis-projection/  for the original code
Requirements: 
Python 3.11
Blender 2.93 - 3.0
Pip

How to use:
Open command prompt (write cmd in start menu)

Run "git clone https://github.com/3DGameMaker/OffBlend/"

Run "cd OffBlend"

Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Run "python background.py"

Open Blender, then make a new project.

Go into the "Scripting" tab and press "Open"

Choose blender.py

Now make a plane called "Plane"

And keep your camera's name as "Camera"

Now set the plane's X scale to 2.93373

And the plane's Y scale to 1.65022

Now put as many objects on the plane as you want.

Now you can press Alt+P, then Space.

Go into the camera's view and you can see it tracks your head with off axis projection.
