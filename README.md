Live off axis projection with head tracking for blender

Thanks to https://github.com/calcoloergosum/blender-off-axis-projection/  for the original code

How to use:

Run background.py in a command prompt window

Open Blender, then make a new project.

Go into the "Scripting" tab and press "Open"

Choose blender.py

Now make a plane called "Plane"

And keep your camera's name as "Camera"

Now set the plane's X scale to 2.93373

And the plane's Y scale to 1.65022

Now put as many objects on the plane as you want.

Now you can press Alt+P, then Space.

Go into the camera's view and you can see it tracks your head with off axis projection.
