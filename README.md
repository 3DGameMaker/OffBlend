# OffBlend
Live off axis projection with head tracking for blender

Thanks to https://github.com/calcoloergosum/blender-off-axis-projection/  for the original code
Requirements: 

Git (Windows) (install at https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.50.0.windows.1/Git-2.50.0-64-bit.exe)
Git (Linux) (install with commands at https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)

Python 3.11 (find at the very bottom of this page: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

Blender 2.93 - 3.0 (get at https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.93/)

Pip (install with python here: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

How to use:
Open command prompt (write cmd in start menu)

Run "git clone https://github.com/3DGameMaker/OffBlend/"

Run "cd OffBlend"

Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Run "python background.py"

Open Blender, then make a new project.

Go into the "Scripting" tab and press "Open"

Choose blender.py

Now make a plane called "Plane"

And keep your camera's name as "Camera"

Now set the plane's X scale to 2.93373

And the plane's Y scale to 1.65022

Now put as many objects on the plane as you want.

Now you can press Alt+P, then Space.

Go into the camera's view and you can see it tracks your head with off axis projection.
